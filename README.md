# Virtual-Trial-Room-1
Virtual Trial Rooms are augmented reality digital trial rooms for humans to try various clothing digitally, instead of  trying on in real. Virtual try-on technology lets customers see how clothes fit themselves or an avatar, allowing  them to virtually try on clothing before purchasing them, with the help of Open CV (computer vision)
